  Artificial hearts are new technologies that have become a vital solution for patients who suffer with critical heart
  failures with no other treatment options available; this new equipment provides an alternative treatment to heart
  transplantation, which is a procedure which may take too long. The development of Total Artificial Hearts (TAH) and
  Ventricular Assist Devices (VAD) have helped significantly in the management of severe end-stage heart failures of many.
  Ongoing research in bioengineering is developing future innovations which include fully implantable artificial hearts and
  other integrated systems.

        An artificial heart is a device which allows the patient to be cured without a donor heart by using either a temporary 
        or long-term solution for patients who are unable to undergo heart transplantation; this is a very efficient new way to
        cure heart failures and other critical heart diseases which are life-threatening.  The advantage of an artificial heart
        is that most heart transplant patients live much longer and get to enjoy a better quality of life with higher energy levels,
        and it is much easier for them to work and travel due to an improved general wellbeing. (NHS.2022)

  Active  Learning (Angluin,  1988,  Cohn  et  al.,  1994)  is  a  paradigm  where  a  concept  is  learnt  by  an 
    intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning
    epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training 
    instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to  improve  the  classification  
    model.  Various  strategies  have  been  proposed  including;  Query  by Committee  (Seung  et  al.,  1992),Monte  
    Carlo  estimation  (Roy  and  McCallum,  2001),  uncertainty sampling  (Lewis  and  Gale,  1994)  and  version  space  
    reduction  (margin  sampling)  (Tong  and  Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances 
    are chosen at each epoch they are presented  for  labeling,  to  a  machine  (database)  or  human  oracle  that  has 
    knowledge  of  the  class labels.  After  adding  the  newly  labeled  instances  to  the  current  training  set,  a 
    revised  model  is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve anefficient, incremental advancement of 
    learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as reaching a stage
    where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as 
    in Vlachos (2008)
