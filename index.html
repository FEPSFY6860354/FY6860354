  Artificial hearts are new technologies that have become a
  vital solution for patients who suffer with critical heart
  failures with no other treatment options available; this new 
  equipment provides an alternative treatment to heart
  transplantation, which is a procedure which may take too long.
  The development of Total Artificial Hearts (TAH) and
  Ventricular Assist Devices (VAD) have helped significantly in 
  the management of severe end-stage heart failures of many.
  Ongoing research in bioengineering is developing future innovations
  which include fully implantable artificial hearts and
  other integrated systems.

        An artificial heart is a device which allows the patient to be cured without
        a donor heart by using either a temporary or long-term solution for patients
        who are unable to undergo heart transplantation; this is a very efficient new
        way to cure heart failures and other critical heart diseases which are life-threatening.
        The advantage of an artificial heart is that most heart transplant patients live much longer
        and get to enjoy a better quality of life with higher energy levels, and it is much easier for
        them to work and travel due to an improved general wellbeing. <a href="#Reference">(NHS,2022)</a>

            The Total Artificial Heart replaces damaged heart ventricles and valves; it’s
            important to ensure that ventricles are working properly because they pump
            blood to your lungs and other parts of the body.TAH are formed with ventricles
            made from polyurethane which is an artificial material that is very durable and
            flexible; these ventricles are assisted with a pump outside the body called a 
            driver, and this controls the blood flow to and from the heart and must be next
            to the patient; therefore, if the patient were out of the hospital, they would 
            need to carry a portable driver with them which needs to be charged accordingly. 
            However, the Total Artificial Heart is only a temporary measure until a patient
            waits for a potential donor heart to undergo heart transplantation. It has four
            mechanical valves that replaces the heart’s own valves by connecting to the upper
            chamber (atria) and to the major arteries such as the pulmonary artery and the
            aorta; this allows the blood to flow normally through the body.<a href="#Reference">(NIH,2023)</a>

               A ventricular assist device is another form of mechanical pump that’s also help pump blood around the
                body for patients with severe heart failure or waiting for a heart transplant. They are only normally
                implanted when the heart is no longer adequately pumping blood due to weakened heart muscles or other
                cardiac conditions. There are different types of ventricular assist devices depending on which side of
                the heart is unable to pump blood around; it can be used as either a long term or short-term device for
                patients who cannot have heart transplants.  There are three different types of ventricular assist devices,
                and they are known as left ventricular assist device, right ventricular assist device and the biventricular
                assist device; these are implanted depending on which side/s of the heart is going through heart failure.
                These devices are surgically implanted into the chest with tubes that connect to the heart’s ventricles. 
                They act as a temporary assist for maintaining circulation around the organs. <a href="#Reference">(Clevelend Clinic,2022)</a>

          <p style="font-size: 15px;">
            The first initial ideas of artificial hearts developed in the early 20 th century; in 1950 Paul Winchell
            was the first inventor of an artificial heart and developed a mechanical heart which was later clarified
            by medical engineers as he was a ventriloquist. His mechanical heart was never used for a human patient
            however it signified a big step in the invention of artificial technology. The first ever implantable artificial
            heart was founded by Dr Robert Jarvik and was named The Jarvik-7 in 1982 and it was implanted in a patient named
            Barney Clark who is the first ever patient to have a long-term artificial heart replacement. It has two ventricles
            and valves and is designed to be placed in the patient’s chest; unfortunately, although the surgery was innovational,
            the patient only survived 112 days with the mechanical heart, which rose awareness in artificial technology in the 
            industry at that time. <a href="#Reference">(Jarvic et al,1986)</a>

             This was due to issues such as blood clotting, biocompatibility and mechanical failure which was a huge challenge
             as scientist had to find a device that works well for the human body, to avoid trouble finding a heart transplant
             donor. In 1990-2000s, there was an increase in the role of heart transplants so artificial hearts was seen as more
             of a bridge to a heart transplant, however many patients were still on the waiting list. Also, smaller efficient heart 
            was developing during this period and these mechanical devices was a major breakthrough; an example is the SynCardia
            temporary total artificial heart which became one of the first clinically viable temporary artificial hearts and was
            used for patients waiting for a heart transplant but can’t immediately have one at the time being. Then it was the only 
            artificial heart that has been approved by the U.S. Food and drug administration, Health Canada and Consultants Europe;
            it can be used as a bridge to transplant for patients who are waiting for a heart transplantation with a heart donor.
            In the present time, there is more success in the field with even fully implantable artificial hearts available now such
            as AbioCar which was developed by AbioMed; additionally, now many scientists and researchers have started looking into 3D
            printing, gene editing, and regenerative medicine which helps improve the function of artificial hearts in the human body.

            There are many challenges that follow the implantation of an artificial heart into a patient’s body which can be serious
            in some cases; many health issues may arise such as blood clots <a href="#Reference">(Sacks et al,2007)</a> , thrombosis risk, infection risks from external contents
            and in some cases psychological risks. On the other hand,there are also other challenges that affect this process such as
            cost and availability of artificial hearts <a href="#Reference">(Gianpiero et al,2013)</a> and durability and mechanical issues.

            From simple models to highly mechanical models, artificial heart’s technology has developed significantly throughout the 
            years, and it plays a huge role in providing a better lifespan for those with severe heart failure, unable to have a heart
            transplant due to lack of donors. Artificial hearts may offer more successful solutions in the upcoming future and may be a 
            new possible alternative to heart transplantation.
